    "Included in the .zip folder are multiple .csv files. Each .csv file gives game log data for one team, for one year. The teams and years were chosen such that we have data since the year 2000 (excluding 2020 since that year may be an outlier due to the pandemic) for 6 teams each year (the World Series Champion, the runner-up, the 15th seed, the 16th seed, and the bottom two teams). Included in the game log data is information on batting and pitching. Examples of batting data include Plate Appearances, At Bats, Runs scored, Hits allowed, and around 21 other data points for that game. Included in the pitching data is Innings Pitched, Hits Allowed, Earned Runs allowed, Bases on Balls, and around 21 other data points for that game."
