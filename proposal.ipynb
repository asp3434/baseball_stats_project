    "### Background and Motivation\n",
    "*** Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision. ***\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseball teams in the MLB play 162 games each year in the regular season. This means that there is an extremeley large amount of data that can be analyzed compared to other sports that play 82 games (NBA) and 17 games (NFL) during the regular season. A large amount of data on each individual player can help us draw statistical conclusions that we would not be able to with half or an eighth of the data. Sports are a big part of our lives and it would be fun to look farther into the data rather than just listening to the newscasters. We are interested in looking into predictive analytics by analyzing past years data and applying it to the current season.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "*** Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer in your project. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits. ***\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we predict the team that will win the World Series based off the first 5, 10, 15, or 20 games of the season? The fewer games used, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can't determine the answer to the above question, can we narrow it down to 3 or 5 teams and one of the teams in that group will win the World Series?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we predict the league MVP based off the first 5, 10, 15, or 20 games of the season?\n",

    "If we can't determine the answer to the above question, can we narrow it down to 3 or 5 players and one of the players in that group will win the World Series?\n",

    "1) Teams that won the World Series for the past three years, excluding the 2020 baseball season:\n",
    "    2019 - Washington Nationals\n",

    "*** Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup or data extraction? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented? ***\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that the data should already be fairy clean since it is most likely not raw data but has already had people clean it. But we will have to run tests to see if there are any spots with unexpected entries such as N/A, None, etc. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Project Schedule\n",
    "*** Make sure that you plan your work so that you can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team members. Write this in terms of weekly deadlines. ***\n",
