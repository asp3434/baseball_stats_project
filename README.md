# baseball_stats_project

Create a baseball stats project to attempt to predict the winner of the World Series, MVP award, and Cy Young award.

### Notes:
What questions do we want to answer?
 - Can we predict the team that will win the World Series based off the first 5, 10, 15, or 20 games of the season? The fewer games used, the better.
 - If we can't determine the answer to the above question, can we narrow it down to 3 or 5 teams and one of the teams in that group will win the World Series?

 - Can we predict the league MVP based off the first 5, 10, 15, or 20 games of the season?
 - If we can't determine the answer to the above question, can we narrow it down to 3 or 5 players and one of the players in that group will win the World Series?

 - Can we predict the Cy Young winner based off the first 5, 10, 15, or 20 games of the season?
 - If we can't determine the answer to the above question, can we narrow it down to 3 or 5 players and one of the players in that group will win the World Series?

### Data:
Pull data for the teams that won the World Series for the past three years, excluding the 2020 baseball season:
 - 2019 - Washington Nationals
 - 2021 - Atlanta Braves

 - AL 2021 - Shohei Ohtani

### Analysis:
What batting stats do we want to examine?
 - Start simple, use basic stats
 - Where each player is from, including which college they played for if they are from the United States
