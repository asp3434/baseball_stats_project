https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2021.shtml
https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2022.shtml

Steps:
 - Grab link on those pages to the World Series winner
 - crawl batting table to access links for each player
 - grab link to gamelogs for that year (in a dropdown tab)
 - scrape the table of all games that year

 - do the same for pitchers
 
NOTE: There is a button to export the table as a .csv. Would it be easier to select that? Is there a way to do that?
